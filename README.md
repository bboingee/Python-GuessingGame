# Python-GuessingGame
Python program that will ask the user to guess a number in 3 tries

## Instruction
Create a guessing game. Generate a random number from 1 to 10. Ask the user to guess the number. The user will have 3 guess to get the number right. If the user guesses correctly, exit the game and congratulate the user. If not, give user the appropriate error message and exit the game. If the user's guess is +-1 from the answer, display hot. If the user's guess is +-2 from the answer, display warm. All other guesses should display cold.

## About
Programmed by Bentley Kang

This was assignment from software testing class from Per Scholas Inc (www.perscholas.org).
Guessing Game No Functions.py was created on my 2nd day of learning python. Created using while loops with errors and excepts, and if, elif and else statments. Quite a few if statements within a if statements and within a if statements. 

Guessing Game No Functions(Updated).py is updated version of Guessing Game No Functions.py. i realized that there are few lines that are not needed and changed some codes to look neat. 

Guessing Game With Functions.py was created using define functions, passing by reference or by value, fod loops with errors and exceptions, and if and else statements. I would say that this program does qualify the instruction requirements. My other program does functional requirements but does not satisfy all the non functional requirements. 

I stricted myself not to use define functions. After i was done, and started to rewrite with functions, i wanted to use for loop there. to differentiate for loop and while loop.
